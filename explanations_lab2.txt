Goal of this lab is to establish secure communication between a client and server.
This is down using SSL.
To authenticate client, we load the private, public key and certificate.
To authenticate server, we load the root certificate.
SSL handshake is done by SSL_connect().
Server authentication is done by check_cert function.
Check_cert function checks for valid certificate, common name, and email.
When encountering an error, they are handled according to the lab manual.
The server initiates proper shutdown request.
Client/server select the proper connection method according to lab manual.
Client limits the connections method by SSL_CTX_set_options.
